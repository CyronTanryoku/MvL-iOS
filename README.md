<h3>Known Issues</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>This is a web version of the game, not a native iOS port, set up to run fullscreen on your device. Do not seek help for performance issues, your device may not meet requirements.
		<li>Interacting with any text box will zoom in the screen. This can be fixed by manually zooming out via zoom-out touch gestures on the black borders. Due to being a web version, this cannot be fixed.
